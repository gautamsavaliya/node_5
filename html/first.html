        What is HTML
        HTML is an acronym which stands for Hyper Text Markup Language which is used for creating web pages and web
        applications. Let's see what is meant by Hypertext Markup Language, and Web page.

        Hyper Text: HyperText simply means "Text within Text." A text has a link within it, is a hypertext. Whenever you
        click
        on a link which brings you to a new webpage, you have clicked on a hypertext. HyperText is a way to link two or
        more web
        pages (HTML documents) with each other.

        Markup language: A markup language is a computer language that is used to apply layout and formatting
        conventions to a
        text document. Markup language makes text more interactive and dynamic. It can turn text into images, tables,
        links,
        etc.

        Web Page: A web page is a document which is commonly written in HTML and translated by a web browser. A web page
        can be
        identified by entering an URL. A Web page can be of the static or dynamic type. With the help of HTML only, we
        can
        create static web pages.

        Hence, HTML is a markup language which is used for creating attractive web pages with the help of styling, and
        which
        looks in a nice format on a web browser. An HTML document is made of many HTML tags and each HTML tag contains
        different
        content.

        HTML Versions
        Since the time HTML was invented there are lots of HTML versions in market, the brief introduction about the
        HTML
        version is given below:

        HTML 1.0: The first version of HTML was 1.0, which was the barebones version of HTML language, and it was
        released
        in1991.


        HTML 2.0: This was the next version which was released in 1995, and it was standard language version for website
        design.
        HTML 2.0 was able to support extra features such as form-based file upload, form elements such as text box,
        option
        button, etc.

        HTML 3.2: HTML 3.2 version was published by W3C in early 1997. This version was capable of creating tables and
        providing
        support for extra options for form elements. It can also support a web page with complex mathematical equations.
        It
        became an official standard for any browser till January 1997. Today it is practically supported by most of the
        browsers.

        HTML 4.01: HTML 4.01 version was released on December 1999, and it is a very stable version of HTML language.
        This
        version is the current official standard, and it provides added support for stylesheets (CSS) and scripting
        ability for
        various multimedia elements.


        HTML5 : HTML5 is the newest version of HyperText Markup language. The first draft of this version was announced
        in
        January 2008. There are two major organizations one is W3C (World Wide Web Consortium), and another one is
        WHATWG( Web
        Hypertext Application Technology Working Group) which are involved in the development of HTML 5 version, and
        still, it
        is under development.

        Features of HTML
        1) It is a very easy and simple language. It can be easily understood and modified.

        2) It is very easy to make an effective presentation with HTML because it has a lot of formatting tags.

        3) It is a markup language, so it provides a flexible way to design web pages along with the text.

        4) It facilitates programmers to add a link on the web pages (by html anchor tag), so it enhances the interest
        of
        browsing of the user.

        5) It is platform-independent because it can be displayed on any platform like Windows, Linux, and Macintosh,
        etc.

        6) It facilitates the programmer to add Graphics, Videos, and Sound to the web pages which makes it more
        attractive and
        interactive.

        7) HTML is a case-insensitive language, which means we can use tags either in lower-case or upper-case.

        HTML text Editors
        An HTML file is a text file, so to create an HTML file we can use any text editors.
        Text editors are the programs which allow editing in a written text, hence to create a web page we need to write
        our
        code in some text editor.
        There are various types of text editors available which you can directly download, but for a beginner, the best
        text
        editor is Notepad (Windows) or TextEdit (Mac).

        HTML Tags
        HTML tags are like keywords which defines that how web browser will format and display the content. With the
        help of
        tags, a web browser can distinguish between an HTML content and a simple content. HTML tags contain three main
        parts:
        opening tag, content and closing tag. But some HTML tags are unclosed tags.

        When a web browser reads an HTML document, browser reads it from top to bottom and left to right. HTML tags are
        used to
        create HTML documents and render their properties. Each HTML tags have different properties.

        An HTML file must have some essential tags so that web browser can differentiate between a simple text and HTML
        text.
        You can use as many tags you want as per your code requirement.

        All HTML tags must enclosed within <> these brackets.
            Every tag in HTML perform different tasks.
            If you have used an open tag <tag>, then you must use a close tag </tag> (except some tags)
